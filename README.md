**AfroMsg** is a modern, extensible PHP SDK for integrating with the [Afromessage API](https://api.afromessage.com/). It supports token-based authentication, code verification, message sending, and is fully PSR-compliant. Ideal for Laravel and any PHP-based backend.

---

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ Clean and simple API for SMS verification and messaging
- ‚úÖ PSR-4 & PSR-12 compliant structure
- ‚úÖ Laravel-ready (via optional ServiceProvider)
- ‚úÖ Extensible via interfaces (use Guzzle, Curl, or any HTTP client)
- ‚úÖ Fully tested with PHPUnit
- ‚úÖ IDE-friendly with stubs and PHPDocs

---

## üì¶ Installation

Install the SDK using Composer:

```bash
composer require yohacodes/afro-msg-php
````

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create a `.env` file or define your token manually:

```env
AFROMESSAGE_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
```

Alternatively, configure directly in code:

```php
$client = new \AfroMsg\Http\GuzzleAfromessageClient('your_api_token');
```

---

## ‚ú® Quick Start

### üîç Verify Code

```php
use AfroMsg\Http\GuzzleAfromessageClient;

$client = new GuzzleAfromessageClient('your_api_token');

$response = $client->verifyCode('+251912345678', '123456');

if ($response['success']) {
    echo "Code verified!";
} else {
    echo "Verification failed.";
}
```

---

## üß± Architecture

```plaintext
AfroMsg\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Contracts\            # Interfaces for HTTP clients
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Http\                 # Guzzle implementation (default)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Responses\            # Response wrappers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Exceptions\           # Custom exception classes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Support\              # Helper utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AfroMsg.php           # Facade for simplified usage
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ stubs\                # IDE stubs and config templates
```

---

## üß™ Testing

Run all unit and feature tests using:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

We recommend using `Mockery` and `Guzzle MockHandler` for mocking API calls.

---

## üß© Extending

Create a custom client by implementing the interface:

```php
namespace AfroMsg\Contracts;

interface AfromessageClientInterface
{
    public function verifyCode(string $to, string $code): array;
}
```

You can then inject or bind your implementation as needed.

---

## üéØ Laravel Integration (Optional)

For Laravel users, a service provider and config file can be published:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="AfroMsg\AfromessageServiceProvider"
```

```php
use AfroMsg\Facades\AfroMsg;

AfroMsg::verifyCode('0912345678', '4567');
```
